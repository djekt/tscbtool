# tscbtool
A tool for editing Breath of the Wild TSCB files.

The interface is fairly self explanatory (I hope).
The 'Set All' button in the Extra Info section will set the chosen option for ALL tiles. The 'Update' button conversely, will only edit values for the selected entry.
The 'Max Out Terrain Height Constraints' button will set the values for the minimum and maximum render heights for water and terrain to their highest possible values. This will prevent visual artefacts in the heightmaps rendering regardless of how high or low it is. Using correct values is however preferred. The value must be between 0 and 1.

This version doesn't allow for editing of the material table yet.
